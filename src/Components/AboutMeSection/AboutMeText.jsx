        <p className='text-white'>I'm Diluxshan Jogasinkam, a Computer Science (Hons) undergraduate
             at the University of Vavuniya, with a strong interest in full-stack software
              development. I have hands-on experience building responsive and scalable 
              applications using React, Django, and Spring Boot.<br/>

            Iâ€™m a quick learner with a passion for continuous improvement and innovation.
             I enjoy exploring new technologies and solving real-world challenges through clean,
              efficient code. I'm always open to opportunities that help me grow and make a meaningful impact.<br/>

            My mission is to become a skilled and versatile software engineer 
            who builds solutions that create real value for people and businesses.
